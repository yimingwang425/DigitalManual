Currently, users receive SSH products with a paper manual for device use and issue resolution. This method is not only cumbersome but also does not meet modern expectations for convenience and sustainability. Additionally, when a device encounters non-critical issues that can be manually resolved, users often cannot diagnose or fix the problem because they lack the necessary guidance and clear steps. As a result, many simple problems end up as support requests, leading to returns for repair, which increases the company's operating costs and inconveniences users' daily lives. For student users, device issues and the complex repair process can disrupt their study and daily routines, even though many of these problems could be solved with clear guidance and simple steps.

We propose integrating a Digital User Manual feature into the SSH App. Users can simply scan the device's QR code or enter its serial number to access the digital manual. This manual provides detailed usage instructions and self-diagnosis options for common problems. When a quick solution is needed, accessing a digital manual is more convenient and immediate than waiting for support. The self-diagnosis feature can help users solve simple problems without going through the repair process. This is especially important for students, as they can solve issues immediately and avoid long waits for device repair. Without a functioning device, their study and daily activities could be disrupted. By using a digital manual and self-diagnosis, SSH products meet modern users' needs for smart and eco-friendly solutions. This design also reduces support requests and lowers the company's manpower and financial costs, making it more efficient and sustainable for both users and the company.
